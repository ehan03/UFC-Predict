# UFC-Predict

WIP

To-Do:
- Consider scraping [Bet MMA](https://www.betmma.tips/index.php), has information that would make linking UFC Stats and Sherdog a lot easier + historical odds + random stats that might be interesting to explore
- In general, re-run scraping pipelines and work on making them more robust and efficient
- Consider also scraping [MMA Decisions](http://mmadecisions.com/), round-level scoring as well as media scores

Some of my other work built on this repo:
