# UFC-Predict

This project consists of two main components. The first is research pertaining to building machine learning models to predict outcomes of UFC bouts as well as a betting strategy that considers both risk and return. The second is developing a system to automatically collect and clean relevant data (fighter statistics, fight outcomes, betting odds), deploy the predictive model and strategy, simulate corresponding profit/loss, and aggregate/visualize the results.
