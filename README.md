_Applying machine learning and optimization techniques to the UFC_

<br>

The project leverages data from the following sources:
- [UFC Stats](http://ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed) - Bout and fighter statistics
- [FightOdds.io](https://fightodds.io/upcoming-mma-events/ufc) - Betting odds, miscellaneous data not found on UFC Stats
- [Open-Elevation API](https://open-elevation.com/) - Elevation data from geographic coordinates

*This project is actively in development and thus a huge WIP. As such, the README will be updated accordingly.*
